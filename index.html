	 <h2>About myself</h2>
	 <p>
	 	I am a 17-year-old student at IESEG School of Management who resides in Paris. Due to my parents' divorce, I alternate between living at my mom's house with my stepfather and my father's house. As an only child, I value the time I spend with each of my parents and appreciate the unique experiences I have in both households.

     <h2>Hobbies</h2>
	 <p>
	 	As a technology enthusiast, I love to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and innovations in the field. Learning about new technologies and tools not only fascinates me but also helps me understand how they can be leveraged to solve real-world problems.

    In addition to technology, I am also a foodie who enjoys exploring different cuisines and flavors. Trying out new restaurants and dishes is a great way for me to discover different cultures and traditions. Cooking is also a hobby of mine, as I find the process of creating and experimenting with different ingredients incredibly satisfying.

	 <h2>Languages</h2>
	 <p>
	 	I am a French native speaker who is bilingual in French and English. I have been learning Chinese for the past seven years, and I have developed a passion for the language and its culture. Recently, I started learning Russian, which has been a challenging yet rewarding experience. I love being able to communicate with people from different cultures and backgrounds, and I believe that learning languages is a great way to expand one's knowledge and understanding of the world.
